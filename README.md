# Bioinformatics Class Assignment

Welcome to the Bioinformatics class assignment repository. This repository contains scripts and data files used to demonstrate the processes of DNA sequence manipulation, transcription, and translation. The objective of this assignment is to transform a given DNA sequence into its corresponding mRNA sequence and finally into an amino acid chain.

## File List

### 1. `sequence.fasta`
- **Description**: This file contains the origin DNA sequence in FASTA format.
- **Source**: [NCBI - AY274119.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY274119.3)

### 2. `continuous_amino_acid.txt`
- **Description**: This file contains the amino acid sequence resulting from the translation process.
- **Generated By**: `translation.py`

### 3. `continuous_dna.txt`
- **Description**: This file contains the DNA sequence in a continuous, single-line format.
- **Generated By**: `dna_concat.py`

### 4. `continuous_mrna.txt`
- **Description**: This file contains the mRNA sequence transcribed from the DNA sequence.
- **Generated By**: `transcription.py`

### 5. `dna_concat.py`
- **Description**: This script takes the DNA sequence from `sequence.fasta` and converts it into a single-line format, outputting the result to `continuous_dna.txt`.

### 6. `transcription.py`
- **Description**: This script transcribes the continuous DNA sequence (`continuous_dna.txt`) into mRNA, outputting the result to `continuous_mrna.txt`.

### 7. `translation.py`
- **Description**: This script translates the mRNA sequence (`continuous_mrna.txt`) into a continuous amino acid sequence, outputting the result to `continuous_amino_acid.txt`.

### 8. `dna_to_amino_acid.py`
- **Description**: This script performs a complete translation process starting from a hard-coded DNA sequence. It first transcribes the DNA into mRNA and then translates the mRNA into an amino acid sequence. The DNA, mRNA, and the resulting amino acid sequence are all printed to the console.

## Workflow Overview

The typical workflow using the files in this repository is as follows:

1. **Concatenate DNA Sequence**:
   - Run `dna_concat.py` to generate a continuous DNA sequence from `sequence.fasta`. The output will be saved in `continuous_dna.txt`.
  
2. **Transcription**:
   - Use `transcription.py` to transcribe the continuous DNA sequence into mRNA. The output will be saved in `continuous_mrna.txt`.
  
3. **Translation**:
   - Finally, run `translation.py` to translate the mRNA sequence into an amino acid chain. The output will be saved in `continuous_amino_acid.txt`.

## How to Run the Scripts

To execute the scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

1. **Concatenate DNA**:
   ```bash
   python dna_concat.py
   ```
   - This will create `continuous_dna.txt`.

2. **Transcribe DNA to mRNA**:
   ```bash
   python transcription.py
   ```
   - This will create `continuous_mrna.txt`.

3. **Translate mRNA to Amino Acids**:
   ```bash
   python translation.py
   ```
   - This will create `continuous_amino_acid.txt`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Additional Notes

- Make sure the `sequence.fasta` file is in the correct format and contains the necessary DNA sequence before running the scripts.
- The scripts are designed for educational purposes and may not cover edge cases or specific biological exceptions.
